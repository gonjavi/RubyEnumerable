# Ruby Enumerable
This project is based on the enumerable sort module, which is developed in ruby language. It is a project proposed on the website the oding project. In this one we create  some methods that behave similar way than the ruby methods these methods are: My_each, my_each_with_index, my select, my_all?, my_any?, my_none?, my_count, my_map, and my inject. You can visit the live demo link and test them.
